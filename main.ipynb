    "The project follows closely the methodology proposed by Liu, Tsyvinski, and Wu (2022) in their paper titled [Common Risk Factors in Cryptocurrency](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jofi.13119). Researchers and practitioners can use this paper to check the results of the paper and perhaps retrieve an updated version of the basic findings. They can also use it as a toolbox to use for other projects or to run an extended analysis including further risk factors. Finally, asset management firm may use this code to assess the risk of their portfolio or to firm anomalies in the returns of cryptocurrencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis, I occasionally had to make assumption, for example, regarding the procedure to convert daily to weekly data. This is especially so because the authors of the paper did not provide a detailed enough description of their decisions. There are other, perhabs better ways of doing certain steps and I am always grateful for any feedback that you might provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "The order of the following sections is closely following the structure of the paper. The outline is:\n",
    "* [I. Data](#I.-Data): The files for all data sources can be found in the data folder. The main blockchain trading data is retrieved from CoinGecko (coingecko_data.py). It is advisable to download the cryptocurrency data set in smaller chunks (for example, 100 cryptocurrencies), since the data set is relatively large and takes long to download due to the API limit. The merge_data.py file can then be used to merge all individal cryptocurrency data files into one large file that is supposed to be loaded into the code below. The daily crptocurrency (aka coin) data is converted to weekly returns using the last available prices: $$r_t = \\frac{p_t-p_{t-1}}{p_{t-1}}$$ One can also compute log-returns instead. The definition of the weeks is as follows: The first 7 days of a given year are the first week. The following 50 weeks consist of 7 days each. The last week has either 8 or 9 days (if the year is a leap year). "
